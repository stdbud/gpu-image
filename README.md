# gpu-image
Use GPU to compute images.

This is a sample to copy data from an image to another by **OpenCL** kernel, **OpenGL** and **Vulkan** compute shader.  
The building projects are building, so currently you need to make these three drivers(or one of them) available on your platform by yourself first.  
**The answers are checked on Windows**, don't worry.  
It's just only for studying.
